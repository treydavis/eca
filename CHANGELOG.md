# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Support `ask_user` agent questions for remote REST/SSE clients (e.g. `eca-web`): the remote server now declares the `askQuestion` capability, broadcasts `chat:ask-question` over SSE with a generated `requestId`, and accepts answers via the new `POST /api/v1/answer` endpoint. Falls back to the JSON-RPC inner messenger when no SSE clients are connected, preserving editor behavior.

## 0.132.0

- `variantsByModel` entries now support an optional `:api` filter (string or vector) to restrict variant matching by provider API type.
- Custom commands and skills now expose `:arguments` metadata inferred from their content. Previously they always reported empty arguments.
- Native `skill-create`, `plugin-install`, and `plugin-uninstall` commands now declare `:required true` on their arguments in the command listing.
- Fix documentation link in `--help` output.
- Add built-in variants for `deepseek-v4-pro` (`none`, `high`, `max`).
- Improve skill tool description to resolve file paths and scripts mentioned in skill content against the skill's base directory.
- Add built-in `eca-info` skill that exposes the running ECA's information for debugging ECA itself.

## 0.131.1

- MCP tools that return image content blocks (e.g. an MCP image-generation/edit server) now render those images in the chat UI as `ChatImageContent` and replay them back to the LLM as image inputs on follow-up turns when the model supports vision. Implemented for `openai-responses` (synthetic user-role `input_image` after the `function_call_output`) and `anthropic` (mixed text + image blocks inside `tool_result.content`). `openai-chat` and `ollama` continue to receive a text placeholder until a parallel pattern is implemented there.
- Bugfix: MCP tools without a `description` (which the MCP spec marks optional) no longer break Anthropic chat requests with `tools.<n>.custom.description: Input should be a valid string`. Missing/empty descriptions now fall back to the tool's `title`, then to a synthesized `MCP tool: <name>` string at the MCP boundary so all providers receive a non-null string.
- Hook `matcher` now supports object form keyed by tool selectors with per-tool `argsMatchers`; legacy string regex matchers remain supported.

## 0.131.0

- Add `${plugin:root}` dynamic interpolation for plugin-provided config, hooks, commands, and rules.
- Support OpenAI built-in `image_generation` tool via the Responses API for capable models (`openai/gpt-5.x`, `openai/gpt-4.1`). Generated images are streamed back as a new `image` chat content carrying `mediaType` + base64. Available on every provider whose api is `openai-responses` (`openai`, `github-copilot` responses-api models, `litellm`, custom providers).
- Support image edits via the same `image_generation` tool: assistant-generated images now persist to chat history so subsequent turns can iterate ("now make it blue, smaller, with a red border"), resumed chats replay previously generated images, and clients can attach source images either by file path (existing `FileContext`) or via a new inline base64 `ImageContext` request type for clients without filesystem access.
- Fix inline completion crash when renewing auth tokens before completion requests. #437
- Bugfix: avoid `Divide by zero` crash in chat auto-compact when models.dev reports `0` for a model's context/output limits (e.g. `openai/chatgpt-image-latest`); such limits are now normalized to `nil` and `auto-compact?` skips models without a known positive context window.
- Bugfix: image edit follow-up turns no longer fail on the OpenAI Responses API when prior generations are replayed; generated images are now persisted under a dedicated `image_generation_call` history role and replayed as a user-role `input_image` data URL across providers.
- Bugfix: path-scoped rule enforcement now treats a fetched rule as loaded for the current chat, so matching files do not require fetching the same rule again.

- Support regex patterns in markdown agent tool entries (e.g. `eca__shell_command(npm run .*)`) for fine-grained tool approval, currently limited to `eca__shell_command`.

## 0.130.1

- Add configurable skill paths and recursive directory loading for configured rules, commands, and skills; local skills are also discovered from `.agents/skills`. #423
- Bugfix: `/prompt-show` now renders the system instructions as plain text instead of a raw `{:static :dynamic}` map.
- Fix MCP OAuth success/error page never rendering in the browser by sending the local-callback HTML response before invoking caller-supplied `on-success`/`on-error` hooks; previously the MCP callback synchronously stopped the Jetty server inside `on-success`, racing the response flush.

## 0.130.0

- Improve rules with frontmatter filters, condition variables, path-scoped loading, enforcement support, and clearer documentation. #222
- `preToolCall` hooks now receive `approval: "ask"` for the native `ask_user` tool so notification hooks (e.g. matching `.approval == "ask"`) also fire when the chat is blocked waiting for a user answer, regardless of trust mode.
- New `${cmd:some command}` dynamic string backend that resolves to the trimmed stdout of a shell command, useful for password managers like `pass` or `op`. On macOS the user's interactive shell `$PATH` is queried once so GUI-launched ECA picks up Homebrew, `mise`/`asdf` shims, etc. #430

## 0.129.2

- Add support for gpt-5.5 variants
- Restore trust mode on chat resume: `chat/open` and the `/resume` slash command now emit `config/updated` with `selectTrust` reflecting the resumed chat's persisted trust toggle, so the client indicator stays in sync with the server's auto-approval behavior. #426

## 0.129.1

- Fix token usage not being reported in the UI for Google/Gemini (and other strict OpenAI-compat providers) by opting into `stream_options.include_usage` on streaming chat completion requests. #414

## 0.129.0

- Restore the model used at chat creation when resuming a chat: `chat/open` and the `/resume` slash command now emit `config/updated` to realign the client's selected model to the persisted chat's `:model`, and the next `chat/prompt` prefers that stored model over the agent/global default (stale models still fall through gracefully). #417
- Fix `rewrite` hanging on large files by windowing the inlined file context around the selection instead of sending the whole file; configurable via `rewrite.fullFileMaxLines` (default 2000). #418
- Prefix plugin-sourced commands and skills with their plugin name (`/<plugin-name>:<name>`) to avoid collisions across plugins. When the plugin name and the command/skill name are equal the prefix is dropped. #420
- Fix empty `.sha256` for macOS aarch64 release artifact by using `shasum -a 256` (portable across macOS runners) and enabling `pipefail` so silent pipe failures don't hide.
- Fix install page `eca-desktop` download buttons navigating to the wrong artifact (e.g. Linux/x86_64 AppImage leading to `eca-mac-arm64.dmg`) caused by hidden OS/arch panels still intercepting clicks on top of the visible panel; hidden primary tab and OS panels now use `display: none` so their nested `:checked` rules can't re-activate and leak clicks.
- Fix custom tools hanging on Windows by running them through the same platform-aware shell used by `shell_command`, respecting `toolCall.shellCommand`. #421

## 0.128.2

- Sign and notarize macOS native binaries in release CI.
- Disable `ask_user` tool for subagents since they run non-interactively. #416
- Fix low-quality chat titles on 3rd-message retitle (e.g. literal "Understand" on Opus) by flattening the conversation into a single user message so the title model can't mirror prior planning-mode section headers, adding negative rules/examples to the title prompt, and hardening `sanitize-title` to skip a bare leading markdown header when more content follows.

## 0.128.1

- Fix stale system prompt being reused after switching agent mid-chat by scoping the chat-level prompt cache and the OpenAI Responses `prompt_cache_key` per active agent. #411
- Improve chat title quality on 3rd-message retitle by filtering tool calls, tool results, reasoning and flag entries from the history passed to the title LLM, and by respecting the last compact marker.
- Add the `/model` command allowing the user to change the model directly from the chat.

## 0.128.0

- Add `eca-desktop` as an official client in docs and landing page.
- New `chat/list` JSON-RPC request returning a summary list of persisted chats for the current workspace (id, title, status, createdAt, updatedAt, model, messageCount). Supports optional `limit` and `sortBy` params. Lets clients populate a chat sidebar on startup without requiring the user to resume each chat manually.
- New `chat/open` JSON-RPC request that replays a persisted chat to the client by emitting `chat/cleared` (messages), `chat/opened` and the full sequence of `chat/contentReceived` notifications without mutating server state. Intended to be paired with `chat/list` to render a chat the user has not opened in the current client session.
- New `mcp/addServer` and `mcp/removeServer` JSON-RPC requests for managing MCP server definitions at runtime. The server persists entries to the owning config file (project `.eca/config.json` or global), preserving comments and formatting via rewrite-json, and broadcasts a new `tool/serverRemoved` notification on successful removal. Mirrored over REST via `POST /api/v1/mcp` and `DELETE /api/v1/mcp/:name`.
- Extend `mcp/updateServer` to accept `env` and `headers` params, and migrate its persistence off the cheshire round-trip that stripped comments from the user's config.
