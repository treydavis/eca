# ECA Protocol

The ECA (Editor Code Assistant) protocol is JSON-RPC 2.0-based protocol heavily inspired by the [LSP (Language Server Protocol)](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/), that enables communication between multiple code editors/IDEs and ECA process (server), which will interact with multiple LLMs. It follows similar patterns to the LSP but is specifically designed for AI code assistance features.

Key characteristics:
- Provides a protocol standard so different editors can use the same language to offer AI features.
- Supports bidirectional communication (client to server and server to client)
- Handles both synchronous requests and asynchronous notifications
- Includes built-in support for streaming responses
- Provides structured error handling

## Base Protocol

The base protocol consists of a header and a content part (comparable to HTTP). The header and content part are
separated by a `\r\n`.

### Header Part

The header part consists of header fields. Each header field is comprised of a name and a value, separated by `: ` (a colon and a space). The structure of header fields conforms to the [HTTP semantic](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-3.2). Each header field is terminated by `\r\n`. Considering the last header field and the overall header itself are each terminated with `\r\n`, and that at least one header is mandatory, this means that two `\r\n` sequences always immediately precede the content part of a message.

Currently the following header fields are supported:

| Header Field Name | Value Type  | Description |
|:------------------|:------------|:------------|
| Content-Length    | number      | The length of the content part in bytes. This header is required. |
| Content-Type      | string      | The mime type of the content part. Defaults to application/vscode-jsonrpc; charset=utf-8 |
{: .table .table-bordered .table-responsive}

The header part is encoded using the 'ascii' encoding. This includes the `\r\n` separating the header and content part.

### Content Part

Contains the actual content of the message. The content part of a message uses [JSON-RPC 2.0](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification) to describe requests, responses and notifications. The content part is encoded using the charset provided in the Content-Type field. It defaults to `utf-8`, which is the only encoding supported right now. If a server or client receives a header with a different encoding than `utf-8` it should respond with an error.

### Example:

```
Content-Length: ...\r\n
\r\n
{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": 1,
    "method": "initialize",
    "params": {
        ...
    }
}
```

## Lifecycle Messages

The protocol defines a set of lifecycle messages that manage the connection and state between the client (editor) and server (code assistant).

=== "Initialization flow"

    Handshake between client and server, including the actions done by server after initialization.

    ```mermaid
    sequenceDiagram
        autonumber
        participant C as Editor (ECA client)
        participant S as ECA Server
        C->>+S: initialize (request)
        Note right of S: Save workspace-folders/capabilties
        S->>-C: initialize (response)
        C--)+S: initialized (notification)
        Note right of S: Sync models: Request models.dev <br/>for models capabilities
        Note right of S: Notify which models/agents/variants are <br/>available and their defaults.
        S--)C: config/updated (notification)
        Note right of S: Init MCP servers
        S--)-C: tool/serverUpdated (notification)
    ```

=== "Shutdown flow"

    Shutdown process between client and server

    ```mermaid
    sequenceDiagram
        autonumber
        participant C as Editor (ECA client)
        participant S as ECA Server
        C->>+S: shutdown
        Note right of S: Finish MCP servers process
        S->>-C: shutdown
        C--)S: exit
        Note right of S: Server stops its process
    ```

### Basic structures

```typescript
export type ErrorType = 'error' | 'warning' | 'info';

interface Error {
    type: ErrorType;
    message: string;
}

interface Range {
   start: {
       line: number;
       character: number;
   };
   
   end: {
       line: number;
       character: number;
   };
}
```

             */
            askQuestion?: boolean;
        }
    }
}

     */
    chatWelcomeMessage?: string;
}
```

### Initialized (➡️)

A notification sent from the client to the server after receiving the initialize response. This message:

_Notification:_

* method: `initialized`
* params: `InitializedParams` defined as follows:

```typescript
interface InitializedParams {}
```

### Shutdown (↩️)

- Prepares for a clean disconnection

_Request:_

* method: `shutdown`
* params: none

_Response:_

* result: null
* error: code and message set in case an exception happens during shutdown request.

### Exit (➡️)

A notification sent from the client to the server to terminate the connection. This message:
- Should be sent after a shutdown request
- Signals the server to exit its process
- Ensures all resources are released

_Notification:_

* method: `exit`
* params: none 

## Code Assistant Features

=== "Chat: text"

    Example of a basic chat conversation with only texts:

        end
        L->>-S: Finish response
        S->>C: chat/contentReceived (system: finished)
    ```

        loop LLM streaming / calling tools
            Note right of L: Returns first `will`,<br/>then `check`, etc
            L--)S: Stream data
            S--)C: chat/contentReceived (assistant: text)
            S--)C: chat/contentReceived (toolCallPrepare: name + args)

            S->>+L: Send previous prompt +<br/>LLM response +<br/>tool call result
            Note right of L: Stream response
        end
        L->>-S: Finish response
        S->>C: chat/contentReceived (system: finished)
    ```

### Chat Prompt (↩️)

A request sent from client to server, starting or continuing a chat in natural language as an agent.
Used for broader questions or continuous discussion of project/files.

_Request:_ 

* method: `chat/prompt`
* params: `ChatPromptParams` defined as follows:

```typescript
interface ChatPromptParams {
    /**
     * The chat session identifier.
     *
     * Clients should generate this id (e.g. a UUID) at the moment the user
     * opens a new chat in the UI and reuse it across all subsequent requests
     * for that chat. If the server has never seen the id, it materializes a
     * new empty chat record on demand and emits a `chat/opened` notification
     * so other observers (additional clients, remote viewers) can sync.
     *
     * Backward compatibility: clients that omit this field still work — the
     * server will mint an id and return it in the response. In that legacy
     * path no `chat/opened` notification is emitted (the prompting client
     * already learns the id from the response payload).
     *
     * Reserved: ids starting with `subagent-` are reserved for server-managed
     * subagent chats and will be rejected. Ids must be non-blank and at most
     * 256 characters.

* params: `ChatToolCallApproveParams` defined as follows:

```typescript
interface ChatToolCallApproveParams {
    /**
     * The chat session identifier.
     */
    chatId: string;
    
    /**

     */
    toolCallId: string; 
}
```

### Chat Query Context (↩️)

A request sent from client to server, querying for all the available contexts for user add to prompt calls.

_Request:_

* params: `ChatQueryContextParams` defined as follows:

```typescript
interface ChatQueryContextParams {
    /**
     * The chat session identifier.
     */
    chatId?: string;

     */
    contexts: ChatContext[];
}
```

### Chat Query Files (↩️)

A request sent from client to server, querying for available files for the user to add as context to prompt calls.
Similar to `chat/queryContext` but returns only file-based contexts.

_Request:_ 

* method: `chat/queryFiles`
* params: `ChatQueryFilesParams` defined as follows:

```typescript
interface ChatQueryFilesParams {
    /**

     */
    files: ChatContext[];
}
```

### Chat Query Commands (↩️)

A request sent from client to server, querying for all the available commands for user to call.
Commands are multiple possible actions like MCP prompts, doctor, costs. Usually the 
UX follows `/<command>` to spawn a command.

_Request:_ 

* method: `chat/queryCommands`
* params: `ChatQueryCommandsParams` defined as follows:

```typescript
interface ChatQueryCommandsParams {
    /**
     * The chat session identifier.
     */
    chatId?: string;

    /**

     */
    query: string;
}
```

_Response:_

    commands: ChatCommand[];
}

interface ChatCommand {
    /**
     * The name of the command.
     */
    name: string;

    /**
     * The description of the command.
     */

     */
    arguments: [{
       name: string;
       description?: string;
       required?: boolean;
    }];
}
```

### Chat stop prompt (➡️)

A client notification for server to stop the current chat prompt with LLM if running.
This will stop LLM loops or ignore subsequent LLM responses so other prompts can be triggered.

_Notification:_

* method: `chat/promptStop`
* params: `ChatPromptStopParams` defined as follows:

```typescript
interface ChatPromptStopParams {
    /**
     * The chat session identifier.
     */
    chatId: string;
}
```

### Chat steer prompt (➡️)

A client notification to steer the current running prompt by injecting a user message
at the next LLM loop turn boundary (e.g. after tool calls complete).
If the prompt finishes before the steer is consumed, the client should send it as a regular prompt.

_Notification:_

* method: `chat/promptSteer`
* params: `ChatPromptSteerParams` defined as follows:

```typescript
interface ChatPromptSteerParams {
    /**
     * The chat session identifier.
     */
    chatId: string;

    /**
     * The user message to inject at the next LLM turn boundary.
     */
    message: string;
}
```

### Chat steer prompt remove (➡️)

A client notification to discard any pending steer message that has not yet been consumed by the LLM loop.
The notification is idempotent: if no steer message is pending (or it was already consumed at the next turn boundary),
the server silently does nothing.

_Notification:_

* method: `chat/promptSteerRemove`
* params: `ChatPromptSteerRemoveParams` defined as follows:

```typescript
interface ChatPromptSteerRemoveParams {
    /**
     * The chat session identifier.
     */
    chatId: string;
}
```

### Chat rollback (↩️)

A client request to rollback chat messages to before a specific user sent message using `contentId`.
Clients should show an option close to user sent messages in chat to rollback, calling this method.
Server will then remove the messages from its memory after that contentId and produce `chat/cleared` followed 
with `chat/contentReceived` with the kept messages.

_Request:_ 

* method: `chat/rollback`
* params: `ChatRollbackParams` defined as follows:

```typescript
interface ChatRollbackParams {
    /**
     * The chat session identifier.
     */
    chatId: string;
    
    /**
     * The message content id.
     */
    contentId: string;
    
    /**
     * The types of rollbacks to include, allowing to rollback one or more types.
     */
    include: ChatRollbackInclude[];
}

type ChatRollbackInclude = 'messages' | 'tools';
```

_Response:_

```typescript
interface ChatRollbackResponse {}
```

### Chat clear (↩️)

A client request to clear specific aspects of an existing chat while keeping the chat entity intact.
Unlike `chat/delete`, this preserves the chat identity, metadata and any features coupled to it.
After response, clients should clear only the relevant parts of the chat UI.

_Request:_

* method: `chat/clear`
* params: `ChatClearParams` defined as follows:

```typescript
interface ChatClearParams {
    /**
     * The chat session identifier.
     */
    chatId: string;

    /**
     * Whether to clear the messages and tool calls of the chat.
     */
    messages?: boolean;
}
```

_Response:_

```typescript
interface ChatClearResponse {}
```

### Chat add flag (➡️)

A client request to add a named flag (checkpoint) to the chat history.
The flag is inserted after the message identified by the given `contentId`.
The `contentId` matches against both message-level `contentId` (user messages) and
content `id` fields (tool calls, reasons, etc), allowing placement between any message types.
Flags are persisted as messages and propagate automatically with fork and resume.

_Request:_

* method: `chat/addFlag`
* params: `ChatAddFlagParams` defined as follows:

```typescript
interface ChatAddFlagParams {
    /**
     * The chat session identifier.
     */
    chatId: string;

    /**
     * The id of the message after which the flag is inserted.
     * Matches against message contentId or content.id fields.
     */
    contentId: string;

    /**
     * The flag display text.
     */
    text: string;
}
```

_Response:_

```typescript
interface ChatAddFlagResponse {}
```

### Chat remove flag (➡️)

A client request to remove a flag from the chat history.
The client is responsible for removing the flag from the UI after a successful response.

_Request:_

* method: `chat/removeFlag`
* params: `ChatRemoveFlagParams` defined as follows:

```typescript
interface ChatRemoveFlagParams {
    /**
     * The chat session identifier.
     */
    chatId: string;

    /**
     * The content id of the flag to remove.
     */
    contentId: string;
}
```

_Response:_

```typescript
interface ChatRemoveFlagResponse {}
```

### Chat fork (➡️)

A client request to fork the chat into a new chat with messages up to and including
the message identified by the given `contentId`. The server creates the new chat,
sends a `chat/opened` notification with the new chat, then streams the kept messages
via `chat/contentReceived`. A system message is also sent to the original chat.

_Request:_

* method: `chat/fork`
* params: `ChatForkParams` defined as follows:

```typescript
interface ChatForkParams {
    /**
     * The chat session identifier of the source chat.
     */
    chatId: string;

    /**
     * The content id of the message up to which to fork (inclusive).
     */
    contentId: string;
}
```

_Response:_

```typescript
interface ChatForkResponse {}
```

### Chat cleared (⬅️)

A server notification to clear a chat UI, currently supporting removing only messages of the chat.

_Notification:_ 

* method: `chat/cleared`
* params: `ChatClearedParams` defined as follows:

```typescript
interface ChatClearedParams {

    /**
     * The chat session identifier.
     */
    chatId: string;

    /**
     * Whether to clear the messages of a chat.
     */
    messages: boolean;
}
```

### Chat opened (⬅️)

A server notification indicating that a chat exists or was just materialized
server-side. Emitted when:

- a chat is forked via `/fork` or the `chat/fork` request,
- a persisted chat is replayed via `chat/open`,
- a client-supplied `chatId` is seen for the first time on `chat/prompt`
  (the legacy null-`chatId` path does not emit this).

Clients should treat this notification as **idempotent**: if the `chatId`
already exists in the client's UI, no new chat entry should be created — the
notification should be ignored or used to update the title. Chat messages
follow as `chat/contentReceived` notifications.

_Notification:_

* method: `chat/opened`
* params: `ChatOpenedParams` defined as follows:

```typescript
interface ChatOpenedParams {

    /**
     * The chat session identifier.
     */
    chatId: string;

    /**
     * The title of the chat. Absent for client-initiated new chats that do
     * not yet have a title.
     */
    title?: string;
}
```

### Chat status changed (⬅️)

A server notification carrying lifecycle transitions for a chat. Clients
typically use it to drive a "chat is running/idle/stopping" indicator.

_Notification:_

* method: `chat/statusChanged`
* params: `ChatStatusChangedParams` defined as follows:

```typescript
interface ChatStatusChangedParams {

    /**
     * The chat session identifier.
     */
    chatId: string;

    /**
     * Lifecycle status of the chat.
     *
     * - `running`:  a prompt is actively being processed (LLM streaming, tool calls in flight).
     * - `idle`:     prompt finished; chat is ready for further input.
     * - `stopping`: a stop has been requested (via `chat/promptStop`) and the
     *               chat is winding down its in-flight work.
     */
    status: 'running' | 'idle' | 'stopping';
}
```

### Chat deleted (⬅️)

A server notification confirming that a chat was deleted (either via the
`chat/delete` request from this client or via another connected client / a
server-side cleanup such as `chatRetentionDays`). Clients should remove the
chat from their UI.

_Notification:_

* method: `chat/deleted`
* params: `ChatDeletedParams` defined as follows:

```typescript
interface ChatDeletedParams {

    /**
     * The chat session identifier that was deleted.
     */
    chatId: string;
}
```

### Chat delete (↩️)

A client request to delete a existing chat, removing all previous messages and used tokens/costs from memory, good for reduce context or start a new clean chat.
After response, clients should reset chat UI to a clean state.

_Request:_ 

* method: `chat/delete`
* params: `ChatDeleteParams` defined as follows:

```typescript
interface ChatDeleteParams {
    /**
     * The chat session identifier.
     */
    chatId?: string;
}
```

_Response:_

```typescript
interface ChatDeleteResponse {}
```

### Chat update (↩️)

A client request to update chat metadata like title.
Server will persist the change, broadcast to all connected clients via `chat/contentReceived` with metadata content, and return an empty response.

_Request:_

* method: `chat/update`
* params: `ChatUpdateParams` defined as follows:

```typescript
interface ChatUpdateParams {
    /**
     * The chat session identifier.
     */
    chatId: string;

    /**
     * New title for the chat.
     */
    title?: string;

    /**
     * When true, enables trust mode for this chat — tool calls that would
     * normally require manual approval are auto-accepted. Does not override deny rules.
     * Changes apply immediately to subsequent tool calls in the active prompt.
     */
    trust?: boolean;
}
```

_Response:_

```typescript
interface ChatUpdateResponse {}
```

### Chat list (↩️)

A client request to list all persisted chats for the current workspace,
so a freshly-started client can populate its sidebar without waiting for the
user to resume or re-create each chat.

Subagent chats are excluded. Results are sorted descending by `updatedAt` by
default, falling back to `createdAt` when `updatedAt` is missing.

_Request:_

* method: `chat/list`
* params: `ChatListParams` defined as follows:

```typescript
interface ChatListParams {
    /**
     * Optional maximum number of chats to return.
     * When omitted or non-positive, all chats are returned.
     */
    limit?: number;

    /**
     * Optional sort key. Defaults to "updatedAt".
     */
    sortBy?: 'updatedAt' | 'createdAt';
}
```

_Response:_

```typescript
interface ChatListResponse {
    chats: ChatSummary[];
}

interface ChatSummary {
    /** The chat session identifier. */
    id: string;

    /** Human-readable title, when available. */
    title?: string;

    /** Current chat status. */
    status: 'idle' | 'running' | 'stopping' | 'login';

    /** Epoch millis when the chat was created, when available. */
    createdAt?: number;

    /** Epoch millis of the most recent update, when available. */
    updatedAt?: number;

    /** The last full model id used for this chat, when available. */
    model?: string;

    /** Number of persisted messages. */
    messageCount: number;
}
```

### Chat open (↩️)

A client request to hydrate a previously-persisted chat so it can be rendered
in the UI. The server replays the chat by emitting `chat/cleared` (messages),
`chat/opened`, and a sequence of `chat/contentReceived` notifications matching
the persisted messages. When the persisted chat has a stored model the server
additionally emits a `config/updated` notification to realign the client's
selected model (and available variants) with the resumed chat, so the next
prompt keeps using the chat's original provider/model. The same notification
also carries `selectTrust` reflecting the resumed chat's trust toggle, so the
client indicator stays in sync with the auto-approval behavior the server will
apply. Typically used after `chat/list` when the user selects a chat that has
not been opened in the current client session.

_Request:_

* method: `chat/open`
* params: `ChatOpenParams` defined as follows:

```typescript
interface ChatOpenParams {
    /**
     * The chat session identifier to open.
     */
    chatId: string;
}
```

_Response:_

```typescript
interface ChatOpenResponse {
    /**
     * True when the chat exists and its content has been replayed via
     * chat/cleared + chat/opened + chat/contentReceived. False when the
     * chat is unknown or is a subagent chat.
     */
    found: boolean;

    /** The chat id that was replayed (echo of the request), present when found. */
    chatId?: string;

    /** The chat title at the time of replay, when available. */
    title?: string;
}
```

### Chat selected agent changed (➡️)

A client notification for server telling the user selected a different agent in chat.

_Notification:_

* method: `chat/selectedAgentChanged`
* params: `ChatSelectedAgentChanged` defined as follows:

```typescript
interface ChatSelectedAgentChanged {
    /**
     * The chat session identifier the change applies to.
     *
     * When provided, the server persists the selection on this specific
     * chat record and the resulting `config/updated` broadcast carries the
     * same `chatId` so clients scope the update to one chat. When omitted,
     * the change is treated as session-wide (legacy behavior).
     */
    chatId?: string;

    /**
     * The selected agent.
     */
    agent: ChatAgent;
}
```

> **Backward compatibility:** The legacy method `chat/selectedBehaviorChanged` with `{ behavior: string }` is still supported.

### Chat selected model changed (➡️)

A client notification for server telling the user selected a different model in chat.
Server will respond with a `config/updated` notification containing the available variants for the selected model
and the suggested variant to select (if any).

* params: `ChatSelectedModelChanged` defined as follows:

```typescript
interface ChatSelectedModelChanged {

     *
     * When provided, the server persists model + variant on this specific
     * chat record and the resulting `config/updated` broadcast carries the
     * same `chatId` so clients scope the update to one chat. When omitted,
     * the change is treated as session-wide (legacy behavior).
     */
    chatId?: string;

    /**
     * The selected model (full model name, e.g. "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5").
     */
    model: Model;

    /**
     * The currently selected variant (if any).
     * When the new model does not support this variant, the server
     * will emit select-variant null to clear the selection.
     */
    variant?: string;
}
```

### Chat ask question (↪️)

A server request to ask the user a question and receive an answer during a chat session.

     * leave other chats untouched. When absent, the update is session-wide
     * and clients should apply the per-chat fields to every chat (legacy
     * behavior, used for the initial config push and other genuinely
     * session-wide events).

    /** Model capabilities. */
    capabilities: {
        reason: boolean;
        vision: boolean;
        tools: boolean;
        webSearch: boolean;
    };

```

### Login Provider (↩️)

Initiates a login flow for a provider. Two-round-trip design: calling without a method returns
available methods to choose from; calling with a method starts the authentication flow and
returns an action descriptor telling the client what to render.

_Request:_

* method: `providers/login`
* params: `ProvidersLoginParams` defined as follows:

```typescript
interface ProvidersLoginParams {
    /** The provider to log in to (e.g. "anthropic"). */
    provider: string;
    /** The login method to use. Omit on first call to get available methods. */
    method?: string;
}
```

_Response:_

* result: One of the following action descriptors:

```typescript
/** Multiple methods available — client should present choice and re-call with method. */
interface ChooseMethodAction {
    action: 'choose-method';
    methods: LoginMethod[];
}

/** Browser-based OAuth — client opens URL, optionally collects a code. */
interface AuthorizeAction {
    action: 'authorize';
    /** The OAuth authorization URL to open in the browser. */
    url: string;
    /** Instructional message for the user. */
    message: string;
    /**
     * Fields to collect after browser auth (e.g. authorization code).
     * If absent, the server handles the callback automatically and
     * completion is signaled via providers/updated notification.
     */
    fields?: InputField[];
}

/** GitHub device flow — client shows code for user to enter at URL. */
interface DeviceCodeAction {
    action: 'device-code';
    /** The verification URL. */
    url: string;
    /** The user code to enter. */
    code: string;
    /** Instructional message for the user. */
    message: string;
}

/** Collect input fields (API key, URL, models). */
interface InputAction {
    action: 'input';
    fields: InputField[];
}

/** Login completed immediately. */
interface DoneAction {
    action: 'done';
}

interface InputField {
    /** Field identifier. */
    key: string;
    /** Human-readable label. */
    label: string;
    /** Field type: "secret" for passwords/keys, "text" for regular input. */
    type: 'secret' | 'text';
}
```

### Login Provider Input (↩️)

Submits collected input data (API key, authorization code, URL, models) to complete a login flow.

_Request:_

* method: `providers/loginInput`
* params: `ProvidersLoginInputParams` defined as follows:

```typescript
interface ProvidersLoginInputParams {
    /** The provider being logged in to. */
    provider: string;
    /** The collected input data. Keys match the field keys from the action descriptor. */
    data: Record<string, string>;
}
```

_Response:_

* result: `{ action: 'done' }`

### Logout Provider (↩️)

Clears authentication for a provider and re-syncs available models.

_Request:_

* method: `providers/logout`
* params: `ProvidersLogoutParams` defined as follows:

```typescript
interface ProvidersLogoutParams {
    /** The provider to log out of. */
    provider: string;
}
```

_Response:_

* result: `{}`

### Provider Updated (⬅️)

A server notification sent when a provider's authentication state or available models change.
Sent after login completion, logout, token renewal, or model sync. Contains the full provider
status (same shape as items in `providers/list` response).

_Notification:_

* method: `providers/updated`
* params: `ProviderStatus` (see `providers/list` response above)

## Background Jobs

### List Jobs (↩️)

Returns all active (non-evicted) background jobs across all chats.

_Request:_

* method: `jobs/list`
* params: `{}` (none)

_Response:_

* result: `JobsListResult` defined as follows:

```typescript
interface JobsListResult {
    jobs: JobSummary[];
}

interface JobSummary {
    /** Unique job identifier (e.g. "job-1"). */
    id: string;
    /** Job type (currently always "shell"). */
    type: string;
    /** Current status. */
    status: "running" | "completed" | "failed" | "killed";
    /** Human-readable label (the command string). */
    label: string;
    /** Brief description of the job purpose (e.g. "dev-server"), or null if not provided. */
    summary: string | null;
    /** ISO 8601 timestamp of when the job started. */
    startedAt: string;
    /** Human-readable elapsed time (e.g. "5m23s"). */
    elapsed: string;
    /** Process exit code, or null if still running. */
    exitCode: number | null;
    /** The chat that spawned this job. */
    chatId: string;
    /** Display label for the chat (title or chat-id fallback). */
    chatLabel: string;
}
```

### Kill Job (↩️)

Terminates a running background job.

_Request:_

* method: `jobs/kill`
* params: `JobsKillParams` defined as follows:

```typescript
interface JobsKillParams {
    /** The job ID to kill. */
    jobId: string;
}
```

_Response:_

* result: `{ killed: boolean }`

### Read Job Output (↩️)

Returns the currently buffered output lines for a background job. This is a snapshot read
that does not affect the LLM's incremental read cursor.

_Request:_

* method: `jobs/readOutput`
* params: `JobsReadOutputParams` defined as follows:

```typescript
interface JobsReadOutputParams {
    /** The job ID to read output from. */
    jobId: string;
}
```

_Response:_

* result: `JobsReadOutputResult` defined as follows:

```typescript
interface JobsReadOutputResult {
    /** Buffered output lines (up to 2000 most recent), tagged with stream source. */
    lines: OutputLine[];
    /** Current job status. */
    status: "running" | "completed" | "failed" | "killed";
    /** Process exit code, or null if still running. */
    exitCode: number | null;
}

interface OutputLine {
    /** The text content of the line. */
    text: string;
    /** Which stream produced this line. */
    stream: "stdout" | "stderr";
}
```

### Jobs Updated (⬅️)

A server notification sent when the background jobs list changes. Sent after a job is
created, completes, fails, is killed, or is evicted. Contains the full list of active jobs.

_Notification:_

* method: `jobs/updated`
* params: `JobsListResult` (see `jobs/list` response above)

## General features

### progress (⬅️)

A notification from the server reporting the progress of an initialization task. Each task
sends a `start` notification when it begins and a `finish` notification when it completes (or fails).
Clients can track all tasks to derive aggregate initialization progress.

_Notification:_

* method: `$/progress`
* params: `ProgressParams` defined as follows:

```typescript
interface ProgressParams {
  /** Whether this task is starting or finishing. */
  type: "start" | "finish";
  /** Stable identifier for the task (e.g. "models", "plugins", "mcp-servers"). */
  taskId: string;
  /** Human-readable label for the task. */
  title: string;
}
```

### showMessage (⬅️)

A notification from server telling client to present a message to user.

_Notification:_ 

* method: `$/showMessage`
* params: `ShowMessageParams` defined as follows:

```typescript
type ShowMessageParams = Error;
```
